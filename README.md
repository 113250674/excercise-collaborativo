# Making a website as a team (Git collabotation)

Practice your skills in GIT while developing your porfolio website.

Each student works on a different file, for a different part of the website and the most senior can work as Team Leader (for integration and deployment). The Html-Template-Engine library will take care of putting all the pieces together.

## Instructions

1. The Team Leader should fork this repository on github.com and invite other collaborators.
2. Then, clone your new repository.
3. Students must push any changes to the new respository you have just created, you are going to help them resolve conflicts and follow the github workflow (add, commit, pull push).
```sh
$ git push origin master
```

## Now your students can download your repository and collaborate with you

1. Pick what website you want to build with your students.

2. Each student will have to clone your new repository and develop one piece of the website you have chosee, each project is divided in pieces inside its **templates/** directory.

3. When students finish, they have to commit and push to your repository.
